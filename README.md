## 1Bot - One bot, several uses.

[![Banner](https://1bot.netlify.app/banner.png)](https://1bot.netlify.app/)

1Bot is a multipurpose bot that has all the moderation tools you need, lots of useful utility commands, and a bunch of fun commands that we all need once in a while.

- [Add the bot to your server](https://dsc.gg/1bot)
- [Website (with command list)](https://1bot.opensourze.gq)
- [Support and Updates Server](https://discord.gg/JGcnKxEPsW)
- [Top.gg page (upvote 1Bot!)](https://top.gg/bot/884080176416309288)

### Self-hosting?

1Bot is a public bot, so it's best to just add it to your server.

The code is open-source only so that people can contribute to the bot and also in case anyone needs to refer to some code for help with discordpy development.  
The code is not at all optimised for customisation or self-hosting.

Remember: 1Bot is under the [GNU AGPL-3.0 License](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html), which means cloning the bot and claiming it as your own is a license violation. This also includes modified clones, by the definition of "modified version" according to the license.
